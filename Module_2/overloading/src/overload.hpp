// Write three functions (called area) that calculate:
// 1. area of a circle (1 parameter, int) and returns the result as a double
// 2. area of a rectangle (2 parameters, 2 ints) and returns the result as a double
// 3. area of a trapezoid (3 parameters, 3 ints) and return the result as a double

// Write three functions (called add) that add together:
// 1. two integers and return the sum as int
// 2. two doubles and return the sum as double
// 3. two strings and return the result of concatenation as a string

// Write one template function (called sum) that adds two variables of generic type T together and returns the sum as T
// Remember that also template implementations have to be in the header file!
