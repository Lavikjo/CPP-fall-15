title: Bug tracker
task_id: M4-WRAPPER
points: 4


**Objective:** Practice resource management and exceptions, and
porting a C program to C++

*bug.c*, *bug.h*, *software.c* and *software.h* implement a small bug
 tracking system that you need to convert to C++, by implementing
 **Bug** class and **Software** class. Follow the detailed
 instructions in the header files (**softwarew.hpp** and
 **bugw.hpp**). Your C++ implementation should call the corresponding
 functions in the C implementation (hence the task name).
