/* Implement the class DiagonalPrinter here
 * The class inherits (public inheritance) class StringPrinter
 *
 * DiagonalPrinter prints a string diagonally
 * l        -
 *  i       -
 *   k      -
 *    e     -
 *          -
 *      t   -
 *       h  -
 *        i -
 *         s-
 * Where the dash (-) indicates a newline character.
 * Additionally and optionally, this printer can print a special first and
 *  last line for its output. This functionality is disabled by default.
 *
 * The DiagonalPrinter is constructed with three parameters
 *  The first line - "" by default, i.e. it is not printed at all
 *  The last line  - "" by default, i.e. it is not printed at all either
 *  The output stream
 *
 * Note that the default print functionality does not suffice for this class
 *  and you will have to implement the print overload yourself.
 *
 * Implement the class accordingly.
