/* Implement the abstract base class StringPrinter here
 *
 * The base class contains the following pure virtual member functions
 *  A constructor that takes one parameter:
 *   std::ostream& with the default value std::cout
 *  A clone() function that copies the object and returns StringPrinter*
 *  Function call operator overload, i.e. this base class is a function object
 *   that takes one one std::string argument.
 *   Returns a reference to the StringPrinter object meaning that this
 *   function call operation can be "chained", e.g.
 *   object("First")("Second")("Third");
 *
 * The base class contains the following protected member:
 *  An std::ostream reference which is the output stream
 *
 * Implement the class accordingly and do not forget the virtual destructor..
