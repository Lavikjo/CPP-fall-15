title: Rectangle
task_id: M1-RECT
points: 1

**Objective:** Practice use of I/O streams.

Implement function **rectangle()** that asks two values from standard
input, for the width and height of the rectangle (in floating point
format), and outputs the area and circumference of the rectangle.
Input and output should look exactly like the following:

<pre>
Please enter base and height
<font color="red">2.5
3</font>
Area: 7.5
Circumference: 11
</pre>

In above, the red lines are entered by user, and black lines are
output by the system. User input can be any floating point numbers.
You should use the C++ *iostream* functions, not the traditional
C-style I/O.
