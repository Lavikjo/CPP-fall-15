**Objective:** More exercise on basic class definitions, this you'll
practice also the class definitions in the header files. This exercise
combines many of the topics discussed above (vectors, classes, etc.)

Implement a simple library customer system that has two classes:

  * **Customer** instance stands for single customer in a library.
	Customer has a *name* and *customer ID*, and for each customer the
	books in load are stored. You will need to complete the customer
	class definition in **customer.hpp**, and actual implementation of
	the functions in **customer.cpp**.

  * **Book** stands for single book in library. Book has a title,
	author, ISBN, and its loan status is also stored with the book
	instance. You will need to complete the class definition in
	**book.hpp**, and implementation in **book.cpp**.

Again you will need to read the detailed descriptions of the functions
and required members in the two header files.
